### iOS

This plugin requires iOS 9.0 or higher.

Starting with version **0.8.1** the iOS implementation uses PHPicker to pick (multiple) images on iOS 14 or higher.
As a result of implementing PHPicker it becomes impossible to pick HEIC images on the iOS simulator in iOS 14+. This is a known issue. Please test this on a real device, or test with non-HEIC images until Apple solves this issue. [63426347 - Apple known issue](https://www.google.com/search?q=63426347+apple&sxsrf=ALeKk01YnTMid5S0PYvhL8GbgXJ40ZS[â€¦]t=gws-wiz&ved=0ahUKEwjKh8XH_5HwAhWL_rsIHUmHDN8Q4dUDCA8&uact=5)

Add the following keys to your _Info.plist_ file, located in `<project root>/ios/Runner/Info.plist`:

* `NSPhotoLibraryUsageDescription` - describe why your app needs permission for the photo library. This is called _Privacy - Photo Library Usage Description_ in the visual editor.
* `NSCameraUsageDescription` - describe why your app needs access to the camera. This is called _Privacy - Camera Usage Description_ in the visual editor.
* `NSMicrophoneUsageDescription` - describe why your app needs access to the microphone, if you intend to record videos. This is called _Privacy - Microphone Usage Description_ in the visual editor.

And import in dart code:
```
import 'package:media_picker_widget/media_picker_widget.dart';
```

## Usage
For android, it requires `minSdkVersion 21`. Change this in `app/build.gradle`.

In your widget tree, simple add the `MediaPicker` class that extends `StatefulWidget` and you are good to go!
```
MediaPicker(
  mediaList: mediaList, //let MediaPicker know which medias are already selected by passing the previous mediaList
  onPick: (selectedList){
    print('Got Media ${selectedList.length}');
  },
  onCancel: ()=> print('Canceled'),
  mediaCount: MediaCount.single,
  mediaType: MediaType.image,
  decoration: PickerDecoration(),
)
```
